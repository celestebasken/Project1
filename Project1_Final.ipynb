    "Introduction: \n",
    "\n",
    "Operation Condor was a coordinated effort among South American dictatorships in the period 1960-1990, led by Chile under Augusto Pinochet, with active participation from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and later involvement by Ecuador and Peru. It aimed to suppress political dissent and eliminate opposition figures, while opening the economy to greater outside involvement from western powers like the United States. It is important to note that although there was central communication, dictatorships held power during different years in various countries, since they were not centrally installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "While most contemporary analyses of the Condor dictatorships focus on human rights and justice, there were also economic, social, and political changes inherent in the new regimes that had significant implications for development, agriculture, and population demographics. We seek to explore this using the World Bank World Development Indicators that are publicly available at [https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators).

This indicates a low development, including a high population growth rate, shorter life-spans, and a high total fertility rate. By 1990, many of these pyramids have grown wider in the middle, indicating a country's move from low-income to middle-income status. For example, compare Chile (1960) to Chile (1990) to see the growth of the middle-aged cohort.\n",

    "Thomas Malthus claimed that basic population modeling presents a scary vision of human growth. He argued that human population growth is exponential, while the productivity of agricultural production grows linearly. Therefore, he posited that humans would suffer or turn to other mechanisms of population regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is interesting in the context of Operation Condor. Condor occured in low- and middle-income countries, which often started the 1960s with low agricultural productivity and high population growth rates. The capitalist dictatorships developed through Operation Condor viewed economic development and capitalist free enterprise as essential components of their development strategy. They employed mass terror as a tool of despotic control. In smaller countries or those with more extreme violence, the scale of these atrocities affected the overall population size, as Malthus predicted that warfare might.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Malthusian theory did not play out in Condor countries. The dictatorships, with US and western support, imported new agricultural technologies and limited regulations, enabling increased agricultural productivity. Population growth slowed as the economy developed. Even after the end of the dictatorships, the development and international technologies imported during this period led to near-linear population growth, as seen below."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project sought to understand the implications of Operation Condor across a variety of indicators not typically associated with this political era. We began by creating basic population functions and dataframes for our target Condor countries in order to better handle and experiment with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We employed a variety of visualizations to better understand the impact of the Condor dictatorships on key demographic, economic, and agricultural indicators in target countries. As demonstrated, the programs of economic development and growth implemented during the Condor period led to shifts in population demography as target countries shifted from low- to middle-income and their workforces urbanized. These changes are evident in graphs depicting agricultural production, importation, and exportation. Since Condor-era regimes were often focused on advancing an export-driven and increasingly globalized economy, the effects can be seen clearly. \n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate that although historians and data scientists tend to focus on the humanitarian and political repercussions of this oppressive period, there were also important implications for population, agriculture, and the economy. "
