You can find the first edition at the link above. The main argument is spelled out in Chapter 1, which I encourage you to read.  A key point of the essay begins with [two postulata](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/311#Malthus_0195_20):\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **First:** That food is necessary to the existence of man.\n",
    "-   **Secondly:** That the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state.\n",
    "\n",
    "These lead to a conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming then, my postulata as granted, I say, that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.  Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio. A slight acquaintance with numbers will shew the immensity of the first power in comparison of the second.\n",
