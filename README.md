Operation Condor was a coordinated effort among South American dictatorships in the period 1960-1990, led by Chile under Augusto Pinochet, with active participation from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and later involvement by Ecuador and Peru. It aimed to suppress political dissent and eliminate opposition figures, while opening the economy to greater outside involvement from western powers like the United States. It is important to note that although there was central communication, dictatorships held power during different years in various countries, since they were not centrally installed.

While most contemporary analyses of the Condor dictatorships focus on human rights and justice, there were also economic, social, and political changes inherent in the new regimes that had significant implications for development, agriculture, and population demographics. We seek to explore this using the World Bank World Development Indicators that are publicly available at [https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators). 

## Sources and notes

In addition to the World Bank World Development Indicators, we also used the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's [FAOSTAT statistics](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home). We isolated South American countries involved in operation condor for our data exploration.
